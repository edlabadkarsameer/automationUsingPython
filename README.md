# automationUsingPython
In this project, We are using python's serial library to automate the appliances and Arduino Nano as hardware.

  An example of using the Arduino board to receive data from the computer. In
  this case, the Arduino boards turns on an LED when it receives the character
  'H', and turns off the LED when it receives the character 'L'.

  The data can be sent from the Arduino Serial Monitor, or another program like
  Processing (see code below), Flash (via a serial-net proxy), PD, or Max/MSP.

  The circuit:
  - LED connected from digital pin 13 to ground through 220 ohm resistor
